            <p>Introduced by Howard Gardner in 1983, the Theory of Multiple Intelligences proposes that human intelligence is not a single general ability but comprises various distinct modalities. This framework has gained popularity among educators who develop varied teaching strategies to cater to different student strengths.</p>
